# High Ground Alert

Determine whether you are in the path of the mudflows that would be produced by an eruption of Mt. Rainier.

Beta is live [on Heroku](https://hga.herokuapp.com/)!

## Deploying
The GitHub master branch from [HighGroundAlert/high-ground-alert](https://github.com/HighGroundAlert/high-ground-alert) will automatically be deployed to the main Heroku app, HGA. All Pull Requests opened against master will create new test apps in Heroku! Let's test that out, as it's still a [beta](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration#review-apps).
